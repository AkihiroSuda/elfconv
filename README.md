# elfconv
elfconv is an experimental AOT compiler that translates a Linux ELF binary to executable WebAssembly.
elfconv converts a original ELF binary to the LLVM bitcode using [remill](https://github.com/lifting-bits/remill) (library for lifting machine code to LLVM bitcode)
and elfconv uses [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten) (for browser) or [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) (for WASI runtimes) in order to generate the WASM binary from the LLVM bitcode file.

## Status
"**elfconv is a work in progress**" and the test is insufficient, so you may fail to compile your ELF binary or execute the generated WASM binary. Current limitations are as follows.
- Only support of aarch64 ELF binary as a input binary
    - Furthermore, a part of aarch64 instructions are not supported. if the instruction of your ELF binary is not supported, elfconv outputs the message (\[WARNING\] Unsupported instruction at 0x...)
- No support of stripped binaries
- No support of shared objects
- a lot of Linux system calls are unimplemented(ref: `runtime/Syscall.cpp`)
## Quick Start
You can try elfconv using docker container (amd64 and arm64) by executing the commands as follows.
In default settings, both `elflift` (used for generating LLVM bitcode file) and `libelfconv.a` (used for executing generated LLVM bitcode) are installed to `~/.elfconv`.
You can execute WASM application on the both browser and host environment (WASI runtimes).
> [!WARNING]
> The container generated by the Dockerfile includes the installation of [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk). However, wasi-sdk doesn't release the package for arm64, so we build wasi-sdk in the arm64 container image, and it takes long times. If you just try elfconv, it might be good to elfconv release packages, or comment out the lines of the installation of wasi-sdk (The relevant part is as follows in the Dockerfile) and use emscripten instead of that.
> ```sh
> elif [ "$( uname -m )" = "aarch64" ]; then \
>     cd /root && git clone --recursive https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk.git; \
>     cd wasi-sdk && NINJA_FLAGS=-v make package; \
> fi
> ```
### Browser
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv
$ cd elfconv
$ docker build . -t elfconv-image
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --name elfconv-container elfconv-image
### ENTRYPOINT: elfconv/scripts/container-entry-point.sh
### running build and test ...
# You can test elfconv using `bin/elfconv.sh`
~/elfconv# cd bin
~/elfconv/bin# TARGET=wasm-browser ./elfconv.sh /path/to/ELF # e.g. ../exmaples/eratosthenes_sieve/a.out
~/elfconv/bin# emrun --no_browser --port 8080 exe.wasm.html
Web server root directory: /root/elfconv/bin
Now listening at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```
Now, the WASM application server has started, so that you can access it (e.g. http://localhost:8080/exe.wasm.html) from outside the container.
### Host (WASI runtimes)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv
$ cd elfconv
$ docker build . -t elfconv-image
$ docker run -it --name elfconv-container elfconv-image
### ENTRYPOINT: elfconv/scripts/container-entry-point.sh
### running build and test ...
# You can test elfconv using `bin/elfconv.sh`
~/elfconv# cd bin
~/elfconv/bin# TARGET=wasm-host ./elfconv.sh /path/to/ELF # e.g. ../exmaples/eratosthenes_sieve/a.out
~/elfconv/bin# wasmedge exe.wasm # wasmedge is preinstalled
```
## Build
You can easily build and develop elfconv on the container. Thus, please see [Quick Start](#quick-start) and prepare the docker container if you have not done it.

After executing `./scripts/build.sh` (please see [Quick Start](#quick-start)) , `elfconv/build` directory is generated and you can build with ninja build system. `ninja` builds the module that translates the ELF binary to LLVM bitcode (`backend/remill/` and `lifter/`).

```shell
~/elfconv/build# ninja
```

After that, you can compile the ELF binary to the WASM binary using `scripts/dev.sh` as follows. `dev.sh` execute the translation and compiles the `runtime/` (statically linked with generated LLVM bitcode) and generate the WASM binary. when you execute the script, you should explicitly specify the path of elfconv directory (`/root/elfconv` on the container) with `NEW_ROOT` or rewrite the `ROOT_DIR` in `dev.sh`. 
```shell
### Browser
~/elfconv/build# NEW_ROOT=/path/to/elfconv TARGET=wasm-browser ../scripts/dev.sh path/to/ELF # generate the WASM binary under the elfconv/build/lifter
~/elfconv/build# emrun --no_browser --port 8080 ./lifter/exe.wasm.html # execute the generated WASM binary with emscripten
------------------------
### Host (WASI Runtimes)
~/elfconv/build# NEW_ROOT=/path/to/elfconv WASISDK=1 TARGET=wasm-host ../scripts/dev.sh path/to/ELF
~/elfconv/build# wasmedge ./lifter/exe.wasm

```
