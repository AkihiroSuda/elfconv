# elfconv
elfconv is an experimental AOT compiler that translates a Linux/aarch64 ELF binary to executable WebAssembly.
elfconv converts a original ELF binary to the LLVM bitcode using the library for lifting machine code to LLVM bitcode, [remill](https://github.com/lifting-bits/remill),
and it uses [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten) in order to generate the WASM binary from the LLVM bitcode file.
## Quick Start
You can try elfconv using docker container (currently supported for only aarch64) executing the commands as follows.
In default settings, both `elflift` (used for generating LLVM bitcode file) and `libelfconv.a` (used for executing generated LLVM bitcode) are installed to `~/.elfconv`.
You can execute WASM application on the both browser and host environment (WASI runtimes).
### Browser
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv
$ cd elfconv
$ docker build . -t elfconv-img
$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name elfconv-container elfconv-img bash
~/elfconv# source ~/.bash_profile
~/elfconv# ./build.sh
# You can test elfconv using `bin/elfconv.sh`
~/elfconv# cd bin
~/elfconv/bin# ./elfconv.sh /path/to/ELF # e.g. ../exmaples/print_hello/a.out
~/elfconv/bin# emrun --no_browser --port 8080 exe.wasm.html
Web server root directory: /root/elfconv/bin
Now listening at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```
Now, the WASM application server has started, so that you can access it (e.g. http://localhost:8080/exe.wasm.html) from outside the container.
### Host (WASI runtimes)
The procedure is almost the same as the case of the browser environment, but you don't need to set up port forwarding and should set the environment variable `SERVER` to 1 to build for WASI runtimes.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv
$ cd elfconv
$ docker build . -t elfconv-img
$ docker run -it --name elfconv-container elfconv-img bash
~/elfconv# source ~/.bash_profile
~/elfconv# ./build.sh
# You can test elfconv using `bin/elfconv.sh`
~/elfconv# cd bin
~/elfconv/bin# SERVER=1 ./elfconv.sh /path/to/ELF # e.g. ../exmaples/print_hello/a.out
~/elfconv/bin# wasmedge exe.wasm # wasmedge is preinstalled
```
